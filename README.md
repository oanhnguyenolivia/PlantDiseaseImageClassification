<h1>Plant Disease Image Classification</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project aimed to identify disease symptoms in plants. Leveraging the PlantVillage dataset's 54,305 high-quality images, encompassing 14 plant species with 17 fungal diseases, the project focused on precise disease detection. Through comprehensive data preprocessing and image augmentation, the raw dataset was refined for effective model training. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was meticulously fine-tuned, demonstrating superior performance by achieving an accuracy rate of 99.67%, surpassing pre-trained models. This project contributed to plant pathology research, offering an effective solution for automated disease identification in agriculture.<br />
